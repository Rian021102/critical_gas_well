# GAS CRITICAL RATE CALCULATION WITH CHOKE SIZE SUGGESTION USING MACHINE LEARNING

## SCOPE OF THE PROJECT
This project is built to provide Petroleum Engineers and field operators a simple method in monitoring gas well. As we all realize that gas well is prone to liquid hold up once that gas rate is below its critical rate. To solve the issue this project aims to :
1. Provide the petroleum engineers a mean to estimate critical rate and compare it to the actual rate from well test. If the actual rate below its critical rate then,
2. A machine learning model will estimate the choke size needed to achieve the rate above its critical rate.
The critical rate itself is estimated using Coleman, but if you wish to use Turner Rate you can modify the calculation. It is advisable to use the real temperature instead using an estimation.
